# Cuda

This repository contains some expermimental CUDA using the CUDA Toolkit v10.1 from NVIDIA https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.1-download-archive-base.
I added some libararies and headers out of this Toolkit just to make the projects run out of the box. Important I do not own the copyright of the
content from the Toolkit.

At the moment I following this tutorial https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerated-ray-tracing-cuda
